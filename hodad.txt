<rjbs> QUICK CHALLENGE:  provide a brief summary of the
       rules for Higher Order D&D
<rjbs> HOD is a two player game.  One player is the DM,
       the other represents the players.
<rjbs> The DM's goal is to complete a campaign arc.  The
       Party's goal is to prevent that from happening.
<rjbs> Each round represents one D&D game.
<rjbs> D&D powers include "tempt with magic item" and "high
       XP monster" and "threaten with explusion"
<rjbs> Player powers include "hilarious digression" and
       "arguing a technicality."
<hdp> is "always claims to RP an antisocial lone
      wolf" a GM power?
<hdp> no, it's the palyers
<hdp> because it helps prevent the campaign arc from
      going on
<rjbs> right
<rjbs> I think that would be called, "Brooding PC Broods"
<rjbs> DM: I tempt with a magic item: the party sees a
       glowing sword across the chasm.
<rjbs> PC: The Brooding PC Broods: "That's just like the
       sword that killed my father."
<hdp> very nice
<rjbs> DM: I threaten with expulsion: "The party stayed
       with his parents last week, stop retconning."
<hdp> PC: I fabricate backstory: "That was his stepfather.  His mother
      remarried after his father was killed by that sword."
<rjbs> DM: I use my Campaign Utility power, "Engage the Lone Wolf." // "This
       -is- the sword that killed him, which must be tamed by you alone."
