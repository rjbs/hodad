14:03:20 <rjbs> QUICK CHALLENGE:  provide a brief summary of the
rules for Higher Order D&D
14:03:58 <hdp> haha
14:04:33 <hdp> well, metamagic is a good start
14:05:41 <rjbs> HOD is a two player game.  One player is the DM,
the other represents the players.
14:06:09 <rjbs> The DM's goal is to complete a campaign arc.  The
Party's goal is to prevent that from happening.
14:06:13 <hdp> hahahahah
14:06:14 <rjbs> Each round represents one D&D game.
14:06:57 <rjbs> D&D powers include "temp with magic item" and "high
XP monster" and "threaten with explusion"
14:07:07 <hdp> the temp?
14:07:11 <rjbs> temp
14:07:26 <rjbs> Player powers include "hilarious digression" and
"arguing a technicality."
14:07:29 <hdp> temp what?
14:07:37 <rjbs> tempt
14:07:39 <hdp> oh
14:08:04 <hdp> is "always claims to RP an antisocial lone
wolf" a GM power?
14:08:10 <hdp> no, it's the palyers
14:08:17 <hdp> because it helps prevent the campaign arc from
going on
14:08:44 <rjbs> right
14:09:01 <rjbs> I think that would be called, "Brooding PC Broods"
14:09:25 <rjbs> DM: I tempt with a magic item: the party sees a
glowing sword across the chasm.
14:09:41 <rjbs> PC: The Brooding PC Broods: "That's just like the
sword that killed my father."
14:09:54 <hdp> hahaha
14:09:59 <hdp> very nice
14:10:01 <rjbs> DM: I threaten with expulsion: "The party stayed
with his parents last week, stop retconning."
14:12:06 <hdp> PC: I fabricate backstory: "That was his
stepfather.  His mother remarried after his father was killed by that sword."
14:13:01 <rjbs> DM: I use my Campaign Utility power, "Engage the
Lone Wolf." - "That -is- the sword that killed him, which must be tamed by you
alone."
