obviously there are different powers per phase

some powers can only be used during game time (Brooding PC Broods) or during
non-game time (Request Reschedule)

QUESTIONS:

  * how do players win? maybe it's gold: DM wants fewest rounds, players most
    but then DM-wins is a short game; "hard" player victory is "game disbands"
  * how do you change phase of hodad game?
  * when does a game session begin/end?
