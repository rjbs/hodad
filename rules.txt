Higher-Order Dungeons & Dragons is a game that pits the players against the
Dungeon Master.  The Dungeon Master tries to run a campaign from start to
finish.  The players do their best to the campaign from finishing, or to slow
progress as much as possible.

The game is broken into three phases: the Fodder phase, the Heroic phase, and
the Tedious Endgame.

Each phase consists of game and non-game rounds.
